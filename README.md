# UEE eChanneling mobile application - Year 3 Semster 2
This is my individual part of the eChanneling mobile application, UI / UX improvement and development project for User Experience Engineering module - 3rd year 2nd Semester where you have to select an already existing mobile application (From Google PlayStore or anywhere) and improve the UI/UX of the mobile application.

So we have choose eChanneling mobile application, where I implemented:

* Add an appointment with a Doctor by selecting the Doctor of your choice and by selecting a preferred convenient Channeling Center to you.
* Online payment process for the added appointment upto payment gateway. 
* View added appointments, upcoming appointments and the appointment history of the patient.
* Custom-made Lists for displaying data and interface fragments.
* Custom-made dialog pop-ups.

Main focus of the project development is to improve User Experience by re-organization of the UI components and elements as convenient to the end-user as possible and we have made changes to the color-schema accordingly.
Also, we try to balance the white spaces in the interface and the organization of the elements such that you have clean looking interfaces with easy understandability and with more user-friendliness. 

For the implementation, technology used is Java as the programming language and Android Studio as the IDE.

## important &nbsp; :warning:
Two dependancies are required to run the project properly.<br>
**Add these two Dependencies in the build.gradle file of the project:**

* implementation 'com.android.support:design:28.0.0'
* implementation 'com.android.support.constraint:constraint-layout:2.0.1'
